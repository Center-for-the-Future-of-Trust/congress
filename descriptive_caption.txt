These visualizations trace 150 years of congressional speech length by plotting every recorded speech by date and word count, with notable peaks marking the longest speeches in each decade, allowing us to detect filibusters and long-form oratory as historical signals rather than isolated events. By observing how speech volume thickens over time, how short remarks persist while extended speeches rise and fall, and how topics shift across eras, we begin to see not just when Congress spoke more, but what that means for democratic communication: whether talking was valued, what issues demanded long floor time, and how political discourse stretched or compressed in response to changing norms. Finding filibusters within this landscape is only one layer — the deeper work is tracing how patterns of word use, duration, and thematic emphasis reflect cultural priorities, institutional conditions, and the evolving nature of debate itself.
